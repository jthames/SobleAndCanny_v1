SobleAndCanny_v1
================

Summary:
This are the two most common edge detection algorithms implemented in one menu driven program written in C++.

This program technically is a C++ file but implements no object oriented design. OOD will be in version 2 coming up shortly. 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------


Description:
	
	Part A
	Modify Sobel to output three images. First output image is a gradient
	image from sobel function. Second output image is sobel with a low 
	threshold. Third image is sobel with a high threshold. 
		
		Status: Done and working properly

	Part B
	This section is the canny algorithm which outputs 3 files. First output
	is the gradient image, the second is the peak pixel values which have 
	been calculated and the final output is result of the whole canny edge
	detection algorithm. 

		Status: Complete but working on automatic HIGH and LOW threshold

	Instructions:
	Simply build/run the program making sure that the file chess.pgm is in the
	same directory as your project. Follow the menu prompts. Sample output 
	images are included.
